# Console-Finances
This javascript codebase analyses the financial data of Console Finances over a given period. Based on the
available data, the application features algorithms that show the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


## Design Processs

I relied on an array of programming skills learnt over the past couple of weeks, combining different helpful techniques to arrive at the MVP.

1. **Documentation Review:**
This was a technique I performed both at the beginning of this project and indeed through out the entire process of coding. I reviewed my instructor's lessons  as well as a bunch of resources online.

2. **Pseudocoding:**
This helped me create a map to see which directions I needed to follow. It was a good ice-breaker for this project.

3. **Systematic Breakdowns:** With the help of pseudocoding, I broke down the entire coding process into bits and wrote the codes for each line of execution that led the final solutions I wanted to provide.

## Challenges

I encountered the usual challenges of a newbie in the realm of javascript coding, getting lost at times but using my pseudocode to retrace my steps.

A most particular challenge was working data presented in an array of arrays, something I never encountered during my coding classes. But I relied on documentations to navigate the labyrinth.
